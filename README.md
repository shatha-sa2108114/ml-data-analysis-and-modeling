# Mushroom Classification ML Project

## Project Summary:
- Implementing the complete machine learning pipeline for practical experience.
- Encouraging creativity in problem-solving and dataset selection.
- Promoting understanding by comparing different machine learning models' performances.

## Project Objectives:
- Classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using the Mushroom dataset.
- Interpret the data and the relationships between attributes.
- Clean and preprocess the data for use in machine learning models.
- Train different types of models and fine-tune them to improve their performance.

## Project Motivations:
- With thousands of mushroom species, people are becoming more adventurous in their food choices.
- 'Rare' or 'exotic' mushrooms are often served in high-end restaurants, making them a luxurious food choice.
- To the untrained eye, differentiating between edible and poisonous mushrooms can be difficult.
- This project aims to create models that accurately classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on physical qualities, helping professionals (scientists, chefs) and casual mushroom foragers alike.
